# UTCConverter
A basic DC bot that makes it easy to reference times with others living in different timezones

### What can it do now?
It's not completely finished right now as some functions won't work (like every function except the /time one except you also want to use the function /add-time, so the bot is basically only capable of showing you the current UTC time but still).

### What should it do in the near future?
Still nothing lol

### What should it do in the more far future?
So the plans for the future are to usa a proper time-api as it makes the bot safer, more stable and very likely faster bc my own code is shit.

### Also, what's you mom doin'?
Don't judge my code, its apparently less cheap than your mom.
